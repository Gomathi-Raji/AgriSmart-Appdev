# ðŸ”’ Mapbox Telemetry Blocking Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive blocking of Mapbox telemetry requests that were causing "ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT" console errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Service Worker Updates (`public/sw.js`)
- **Purpose**: Intercepts and blocks telemetry requests at the service worker level
- **Changes**:
  - Updated cache version to `agrismart-v3` to force refresh
  - Added blocking for `events.mapbox.com` requests
  - Returns 204 No Content response for blocked requests
  - Added logging to track blocked requests

### 2. Global Fetch Override (`src/lib/config.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Blocks telemetry at the application level before requests leave the browser
- **Changes**:
  - Overrides `window.fetch` to intercept Mapbox telemetry calls
  - Blocks any URL containing `events.mapbox.com`
  - Returns 204 response for blocked requests
  - Added console logging to track blocked requests
  - Sets global flag `__mapboxTelemetryBlocked` to prevent reinitializing

### 3. Component-Level Safeguards
- **Components Updated**:
  - `FieldIntelligenceMap.tsx`
  - `WeatherMapModal.tsx`
  - `LocationMap.tsx`
  - `LocationMapSelector.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added telemetry blocking check on map initialization
  - Added console logging when blocking is active
  - Extended Window interface for TypeScript compatibility

### 4. Application Bootstrap (`src/main.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Early initialization of telemetry blocking
- **Changes**:
  - Added console log to confirm blocking initialization
  - Ensures config is loaded before any Mapbox components

### 5. Test Infrastructure
- **Files Created**:
  - `public/test-mapbox.html` - Interactive test page
  - `public/test-telemetry-blocking.js` - Automated tests
  - `public/clear-cache.js` - Cache clearing utility

## How It Works

### Multi-Layer Blocking Strategy
1. **Service Worker Level**: Blocks requests before they reach the network
2. **Fetch Override**: Intercepts requests at the application level
3. **Component Level**: Ensures blocking is active when maps initialize

### Request Flow
```
Mapbox Component â†’ Fetch/XHR â†’ Override Check â†’ Service Worker â†’ Network (BLOCKED)
                                     â†“
                              Return 204 Response
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs
Open Developer Tools and look for:
- `ðŸ”’ Blocked Mapbox telemetry request: [URL]` (from fetch override)
- `ðŸ”’ Service Worker blocked Mapbox telemetry: [URL]` (from service worker)
- `ðŸ”’ Blocking Mapbox telemetry for [ComponentName]` (from components)

### 2. Use Test Page
Navigate to `/test-mapbox.html` to run automated tests:
- Tests both fetch and XMLHttpRequest blocking
- Provides real-time console output
- Shows blocking status and effectiveness

### 3. Network Tab Check
1. Open Developer Tools â†’ Network tab
2. Navigate to pages with maps (Weather, Field Intelligence, etc.)
3. Filter by "events.mapbox.com"
4. Should see requests blocked with 204 status or no requests at all

### 4. Console Error Check
- **Before**: `events.mapbox.com/events/v2?access_token=... Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`
- **After**: No such errors (or logs showing successful blocking)

## Benefits

### âœ… Resolved Issues
- Eliminated "ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT" console errors
- Reduced network traffic and improved performance
- Maintained full map functionality without telemetry
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### âœ… Maintained Functionality
- All map features continue to work normally
- User interactions (click, drag, zoom) remain intact
- Geocoding and reverse geocoding still functional
- Weather overlays and markers work as expected

## Technical Notes

### TypeScript Compatibility
- Added global interface extensions for Window object
- Used proper type assertions for browser compatibility
- Maintained type safety while accessing global objects

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers that support Service Workers
- Fallback fetch override for browsers without service worker support
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead from request interception
- Reduced network requests improve overall performance
- Service worker caching improves offline capability

## Troubleshooting

### If Errors Still Appear
1. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5) to ensure new service worker is loaded
2. Check that service worker is registered in Application tab
3. Verify console shows blocking messages
4. Run the test page to confirm blocking is working
5. Clear browser cache completely if needed

### Debug Mode
Add `?debug=true` to URL to see additional logging information.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Add user toggle for telemetry blocking
- Implement whitelist for specific telemetry endpoints
- Add analytics for blocked request counts
- Create admin panel for monitoring blocking effectiveness

This implementation provides a robust, multi-layered solution for blocking Mapbox telemetry while maintaining full map functionality.
